#About
This is a playground for my Java practice. 
Although the programs I write are primarily in Java, they might not be suitable for practical use. 
They're mainly for familiarizing myself with Java. 
I'd like to acknowledge the website "Java Basic Programming: Exercises, Practice, Solution" for assisting me.
