# practice
This is just playground for me. 
Mostly I write Java programs.
So you can look at them, but not enough for practical use but for getting used to Java.
However I refer a website, "Java Basic Programming: Exercises, Practice, Solution". Thank the writer for helping us.
Then hava a fulfilling coding life ! (but you need to be patient)
